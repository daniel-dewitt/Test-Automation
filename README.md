Annotated scripts and GUIs for automated testing and data collection

This repository includes my test automation scripts and GUIs. All scripts are fully annotated to maximize readibility. They are written primarily to function, so the degree of generality and adherence to style guidelines varies throughout. I make changes often and will try to keep all scripts up to date. Many will be written for a very specific function, and usability may not easily carry over to a different test. Some scripts may be utilized better as instructional tools than as test scripts. As with the tutorials, I maintain and support all these scripts. If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to ask.
